# Guardians of the Horde Incursion Fittings

## Capitals

While in friendly space, pilots are encouraged to fly capital ships. They provide dank dps and reps. All capitals are required to meet the same tank requirements as battleships (except dreadnoughts and faxes). This can again be achieved with:

```
Damage Control II
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II x2
EM Ward Field II
Thermal Dissipation Field II
```

Faxes and Dreadnoughts should aim to get 16000 DPS tank after links and any drugs you bring. Sufficient (armor) tank can be achieved with the following:

```
Imperial Navy Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II x2
Damage Control II
Capital Auxiliary Nano Pump I
Capital I-a Enduring Armor Repairer
```

All capitals should include the following refits, as well as anything else you wish to bring:

```
50000MN Microwarpdrive I (or similar)
500MN Microwarpdrive I (or similar)
Capacitor Power Relay II x(all your low slots)
Capacitor Flux Coil II x(all your low slots)
Cap Recharger II x(all your mids -1)
Heavy Capacitor Booster I x2 (or similar)
Navy Cap Booster 3200 x8
Improved Cloaking Device II
```

Some of these items are for sites, some are for travel, some are for evacuation. Your FC will tell you when to refit.
