# Guardians of the Horde Incursion Fittings

## T3C Logi.

The T3C Logis are a safer and generally superior option to a Scimitar due to their superior EHP. While they pump out slightly less reps than a large rep fitted scimitar, they still provide sufficient buffer while in capital fleets and are the only logi accepted while T3C fleets are running.

As with all T3C fits, remember that CCP and fitting agents are bad at importing T3Cs. If you have issues, remove the subystems from the fitting before copying
